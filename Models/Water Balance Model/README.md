# Middle Rio Grande Water Balance Model v1.0

Modeling Engine: Scilab 5.2

Accountability model for the Middle Rio Grande Basin that covers Water Balance from San Marcial twin gauges above Elephant Butte to Caballo Reservoir Releases. 
Demands for surface water releases from Caballo Reservoir are assumed to be the maximum available under the Rio Grande Project 2008 Operating Agreement, which bases releases on water stored in Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs and treaty and compact requirements for sharing water between TX (US), NM (US), and CH (MX). Demands from groundwater aquifers are calculated using a base rate of groundwater pumping from each aquifer, based on historical pumping rates, combined with a variable rate, based on historical replacement of surface water shortages with groundwater pumping.
