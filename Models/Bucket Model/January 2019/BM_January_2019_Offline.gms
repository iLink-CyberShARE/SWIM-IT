Jan 23 2019.  Trying to choke all use to zero with no SM inflows, protect terminal aquifer, starting with almost no storage.

Issues

1. still some urban use (consumer surplus and net urban benefits should be zero at a finite price)
2. EPMI seems to be the problem.
3. Some residual ag use and benefits remaining.


Improvements made since October 24:

1.  keep crop yields constant, not rising with water shortages
2.  keep net revenue per acre foot consumed close: but still ranked:  pecans, veges, forage

Simple calibration comes from:

set gw and backstop price at $1000 per acre to be sure income falls with surface water stress.

Acreage and farm income fall ok to about 60% of base water levels

This model sets aquifer recharge from ag river diversions to zero.

urban pumping slightly higher with reduced river flow for EPWU, as it's the only city using surface water

Try limiting urban pumping and backstop use to base levels and see if urban prices for EPWU uniformly rise when surface supplies fall.  They now do

Fixes sice Sat, Dec 15 2018

1.  (Dec 15, 2018)  delete the upper bounds on urban pumping and urban backstop use appearing near looped solve with stress compared to non-stressed.  Result should raise urban pumping and backstop use with stress


2.   (Dec 16, 2018) Re-introduce aquifer recharge from ag diversions, then check water balance and economic impacts.

     a.  check that farm income and urban benefit impacts from surface shortages still reasonmable.
     Also limit ag + urban groundwater pumping with stress to not exceed it without stress.

     b.  check that aquifer recharge is lower with surface stress than without it, since surface irrigation will recharge less to the aquifer as surface irrigation must fall with no
     offsetting growth in aquifer pumping.

3.   (Dec 16, 2018):  Model name:  rgr_watershed_bucket_dec_16_2018_6pm

     Reduce pumping cost to plausible levels, but allow no pumping growth with stress compared to without. Economic benefits, esp to ag should grow lots,
     as pump costs fall.  Costs of protecting aquifers should also rise, since base pumping is now much higher.

     reducing pump costs below surface costs still not making pumped acreage or use larger than surface.  Checking to see if net revenue per acre foot (variable) is correctly
     ranked for the 3 crop types.   net revenue per acre foot seem wrong...need to check

4.   (Dec 19 2018):  Model name:   rgr_watershed_bucket_dec_19_2018_10am

      Checked acreages to be sure that ranking was still pecans, veges, forage, by making net revenue per acre and per acre foot close, but still ranked
      pecans, veges, forage:  This should cause forage to drop our first when surface water stress occurs:

      WORKS:  Results is 0.74 income earned when surface water falls to 50% of base levels when gw pumping still cannot exceed base levels.
      gw balance is maintained (a_table_00_predictions_hydro) and sw too (a_table_00_graphics_hydro)


5.  fixed: upper bounds pecans/veges no larger under reduced surface water than under base surface water (rgr_watershed_bucket_dec_19_2018_10pm)

6.   Dec 20 230 pm Allowed gw pumping to increase to offset surface water shortages.  REsults are good, as farm income losses are mititgated
     but groundwater balance seems lost. Now fixed

7.   Dec 21 pm:   rgr_watershed_bucket_dec_31_2018_9pm.  Now have aquifer protection shadow prices working for average and terminal periods
     Try enforcing both as well as neither.  Done and working

8.  Dec 22 pm:  shadow prices from 1st unit of cheap bt acreage is zero when water is priced at zero is sometimes negative in early years.
                Investigation turned up no real suspects

                Investigated capacity to pay for backstop water by setting is price at 0 and supply at a small upper bound.  New
                Shadow price of backstop tech acreage is about 200 per acre when basckstop water is free, and is 800-1200 per acre foot for urban use

                added: shad_price_urb_back_use_p(miuse,    t,p,w,s1,s2,s3,s4)    =  urb_back_use_v.m(miuse,    t,p,w,s1,s2,s3,s4)
                added: shad_price_ag_back_use_p (aguse,j,k,t,p,w,s1,s2,s3,s4)    =  ag_back_use_v.m (aguse,j,k,t,p,w,s1,s2,s3,s4)

9.  Dec 23 pm:  added detail on farm income eocnomics as improved sensor detail

10. Dec 24 am:  inserted lower bound of -1000 acres on backstop technology ag use to avoid forcing shadow price of free backstop use at 0

11. Dec 24 pm:  Added max capacity to pay for backstop water for both urban and farm use including spreadsheet worksheets
                a.  opt_shad_p_urb_b_use_p
                b.  opt_shad_p_ag_b_use_p

12  Dec 26 pm:  Increased hot start code to speed up model runs, since model now has 40 runs
                Increased from 2 to 5 water supply inflow scenarios.

13  Dec 28:     Inserted real inflow scenarios from Dave and Nolan's work

14  Dec 29 am:  Added capacity to import surface water above the Caballo gauge at a user-set cost per acre foot with an infinite upper bound on quantity avaailable
                model is rgr_watershed_bucket_dec_29_10pm_5_climates.gms

15. Jan 2 pm:   fixed up placeholder ag net revenue data that had been used to trap errors.  Also split urban price elasticity of demand out by city:
                model name is rgr_watershed_bucket_jan_2_6pm.gms

15  Jan 2-6 pm: Model name is rgr_watershed_bucket_jan_5_2019_7pm_wi_hyp_evap.gms

                Used Alex Mayer's improved data on evap and rainfall: still not varying by year
                Still need to add waterhsed inflows at 5 gauges.

16  Jan 5-19    Model name is rgr_watershed_bucket_jan_19_2019_1132pm_wi_climate_imp_exp.gms

                Main addition is to allow both imports and exports at Caballo, El Paso, and all other gauges
                to handle severe shortages and surplies.  Imports at a cost per af, exports at a lower cost per af
                also now reads Dave Gutzler's and Nolan Townsend's latest (Jan 1) San Marcial Inflow climate scenarios

17  Jan 21      Model name is rgr_bucket_jan_21_2019_230pm

                Replaced old San Marcial Inflow scenarios with the latest from Dave Gutzler and Nolan Townsend.
                Also has actual evap, precip, and watershed inflows provided by Alex Mayer
                Still waiting for Alex Mayer's hypsographics for Elephant Butte and Caballo reflecting
                total surface area as a function of total storage.  Current model has only linear approximation

18  Jan 27 2019  Model name is rgr_watershed_bucket_Jan_27_2019_830pm

                Several smoothing little changes, including putting upper and lower bounds on 4 dimensions of 2008
                Project Operating Agreement, rather than equalities.

                Also simplfied aquifer stresses in terms of (1) overall recharge and (2) overall discharge.
                change in storage now equals base storage + recharge - discharge = simple water balance

* Worked with Alex Mayer on Mesilla Aquifer Regression simulation   (April 16, 2017 - June 1, 2017)

GAMS MODEL UPDATES                                          (June 1 - July 19, 2017)
* Worked with Alex Mayer to get simulation of Mesilla aquifer working, to complement optimization
* Upgraded GAMS optimization model for several improvements

*  Altered years to read 1993 - 2015
*  Introduced 8 article-ready table templates (July 4)
*  Ran very low (10% of historic) San Marcial inflows through the model to test for feasibility and plausibility
*  Model now reads historical gauged flows at Caballo, EP and Ft Quitman, set as constraints for historical policy and historical flows,
*           but not for alternative policies alternative (drought) inflows
*  Introduced approximately accurate Mexico ag data into the model.  Thanks to Alfredo Granados and team
*  Introduced Mexican ag benefits as part of the basin economic objective
*  Model switches into backstop urban when surface inflows fall too low or pump costs rise too high

*  update from August 1 2017 to August 7 2017:  Cleaned up a few typos and Introduced upper bound on MX urban + ag surface use (US - MX treaty)
*  currently August 2017 there is no urban surface treatment in Mexico

*  update beginning October 7, 2017: Introduce equations to account for historical rules governing water release and delivery
*    1.  Caballo releases as a function of starting storage and inflow: substituted lower bounds on Caballo releases under base history with formula for
*               Caballo releases based on SM inflows
*               Also widened bounds on El Paso flows for base history to keep model feasible.
*    2.  (not done yet) Annual allocation to EBID, EP1, and MX based on inflows described in 2008 operating agreement

* update for November 11 2017

* set caballo releases to regression historical level, as a fn of storage and san marcial inflows if beginning of year storage is below 900 000 acre feet
* also need to set release at 890 000 otherwise
* also need to give Mexico the D1 formula in place of Mexico actual data

* need to fix line 2029 constraint on project operation without being infeasible

* update for Nov 18 2017

* releases at least equal to linear regression as fn of inflows and storage
* inserted simple US MX treaty delieries to MX based on Caballo releases with an upper bound of 60KAF
* problem with and without operating agreement produced same answer

* Major improvement for Nov 20 2017

* reduced policy to 2 choices from 3: now, with and without project operating agreement
* kept water supply scenarios at 2: historical and user changeable inflow reductions...runs at 0% historical inflows

* with 2008 project operating: simple regression without intercept.  Requires Caballo release as fn of inflow only not of project storage
* caballo releases approximately fixed to linear regression caballo release rule.  Very low caballo releases with very low inflow, makes up with ag pump
* Caballo releases never more than 820 KAF per year
* return TX delivies to at least 43% of Caballo releases
* Mexico gets 60 KAF or 12% of Caballo releases
* result: with project operating agreement always has lower benefits as it has tighter constraints for actual or potential SM inflows


Improvements Nov 26 2017

Add a sensitivity set to allow multiple sets of assumptions for each set of runs, e.g., varying the cost of the urban backstop technology.
This permits a sensitivity analysis of impacts of changing assumptions.  Sensitivities are (1) reducing cost of backstop technology, (2)
raising cost per unit depth of pumping, (3) increasing surface inflows, (4) raising discount rate

Improvements Nov 30 2017

Added code for pumping cost to be a function of pumping depth...reduces DNPV and increases sensitivity of reduced backstop technology costs on DNVP
See lines 1884-1887

Improvements Dec 12 2017

  Added code for detail on ag costs
  Completed assumptions, results (4 scenarios) and sensitivities tables

Improvements Dec 13-28 2017

  Needs backstop technology for irrigated agriculture
  Needs aquifer pump cost to increase with depth, self-limiting pumping for ag.
  Needs to calibrate aquifer pump depth to calibrate to approximately historical record 1994-2013
  Added output table showing impact of backstop technology cost reduction
  Added code to alphabetically arrange worksheets left to right
  Added code to list all worksheets alphabetically for easy clickable access
  Fixed ag costs, with net revenue closer to history
  Streamlined code to account uniquely for all aquifers for both urban and ag pumping
  Added code for backstop technology use by agriculture if price is sufficiently low.  Typically too expensive at 1500/af for normal use in agriculture

Improvements Dec 30-31 2017

Improved sustainability code:

returns to 90% of full with both asuifers in terminal period
returns to 2.5% of full with reservoir storage in terminal period
tracks shadow prices of terminal aquifer and reservoir conditions

Jan 1 - Jan 7 2018

* exactly 52% of Caballo releases makes it to El Paso Gauge in every year under 2008 operating agreement (moved from bounds to equations); based on hist regression
* exactly 34% of el paso gauge flows makes it to below epid every year under 2008 operating policy, based on historical regressions
* Caballo releases as a fn of SM inflows and project storage moved from bounds to equations,based on historical regressions
* climate stressed surface water supply raised from 0% of historical to 30% of historical
* urban economic variables moved from free to positive variables.  Prices were sometimes negative (nonsensical)
* With these changes, model takes about twice as long to run, about 1200 iterations per run, 20 minutes for a 64 model run
* Results tables look more plausible

Jan 8 - Jan 14 2018

* GAMS model now hot starts: each new optimization starts at the optimized solution of previous optimization.  Speeds up run time by a factor of about 5. Causes fewer false infeasibilities
* Reduces 1200 iterations for typical model run to about 250 per typical model run
* Introduced worksheet showing number of iterations per model run,
* Setting epsilon levels to near zero to assigns very small changes for 4 parameters that change with sensitivity levels
* 4 parameters varied in sensitivity analysis are
*   (1) price of urban backstop technology, with small change
*   (2) cost per foot depth per acre foot pumped, with small change
*   (3) starting project reservoir storage, with small change
*   (4) reservoir evaporation rate, with small change
* Caught and fixed large number of little errors so that sensitivity table 07 results produce more plausible results
* Complete suite of 64 optimization models now run in clock time of just under 2 minutes


summer early fall 2018

* paper under review at J of Hydrology
* asks for revisions with more policy measures and more realistic climate stress scenarios

* as of October 14 2018 now have
* 2 climate stress sceanarios
* 8 policy options 2 x 2 x 2 (all dealing with presence of absence of groundwater protection measures)

1.        1_Obs+Extend Drought:  Average annual observed  (combined-gauge)
          streamflow at San Marcial for 1950-2013.  Annual values from
          2014 to 2099 represent a repeated sequence of observed drought
          years (2011-2013).

2.        2____access1_0_rcp85: Newest iteration of normalization in which
          we normalize by the mean and variance, using a lognormal distribution.
          It uses a 1964-2013 baseline period to calculate normalization.
          It also accounts for trans-mountain diversions by subtracting imported
          water upstream from San Marcial in the baseline period before normalizing,
          then adding back the imported water (estimated from a separate analysis of
          trans-mountain importation) to obtain the values shown.
          Three variations on this basic theme are shown below.

3.        3___hadgem2_es_rcp85   This is what we consider our "baseline" model, which we
          have been using since November 2017.  Normalized flows in this model exhibit
          depletions on the order of -205 kAF/year later this century.
          Need to define depletions

4.        4___hadgem2_es_rcp26 This represents a more optimistic, or closer to the
          ensemble mean condition of -30.2 kAF/year for all 31 CMIP5 (defined as)
          simulations, regarding depletion of flows later this century.  The The Access1
          model above (#2) exhibits extreme depletions (of about -366 kAF/year out of the
          31 CMIP5 simulations) of normalized flows for the late 21st century.


5.        5_miroc_rcp26_r1i1p1 This represents a wetter scenario (of about + 276 kAF/year
          out of the 31 CMIP5 simulations) within the normalized flow regime.


6.        6_Zero_Flow_SMarcial:  Zero flow at San Marcial Gauges in all Years.  This a
          lower bound designed as the most pessimistic possible set of inflows which
          are intended to maximize pressure on groundwater pumping as long as the aquifer
          is economically viable after which use turns to imports.

*A: dh = 1 foot
*d = 62.4 ft-lbs/ ft 3
*dp = d * dh = 0.433 ft-lbs/in 2 = 2.988 Pa = 1.024 kw x hr/ac-ft
*for pumping efficiency np = 50%
*dp =   ?p/np = 2.047 kw x hr / acre feet
*For a cost of energy c = 0.10/ kw x hr
*C = c dp = .205 per acre foot

*  The following section defines models.                                                *
*  Each model is defined by a set of equations used                                     *
*  for which one single variable is optimized (min or max)                              *
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

* This simple prototype model uses ALL equations defined above.  Some larger models
* may exclude some equations. For example, each institution could be defined
* by one equation.  And each of several models might conduct a single policy experiment
* in which that model tries out a single institution.  This would require deleting all
* institutional equations except the one analyzed.
* If you need to EXclude some equations, list INcluded equations where ALL appears below

*  Each solve states a single model for which an optimum is requested.

*  solution appears at that boundary.  If the bound doesn't constrain the model
*  the variable's shadow price is zero (complementary slackness)
