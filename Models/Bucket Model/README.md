# Middle Rio Grande Hydroeconomic Optimization Model

A simple coarse-scale basin model that simulates all major water sources, sinks, uses, and losses. It also includes economic values of water, as well as institutional constraints governing water supply and use for the Middle Rio Grande between the inflow to Elephant Butte Reservoir and Fort Quitman on the Rio Grande. This model is designed to be a useful tool for improving our understanding of the hydrology, agronomy, institutions, and economics to guide analysis of policy and management questions that are important to stakeholders.
